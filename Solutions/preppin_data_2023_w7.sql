-- Preppin' Data 2023 Week 07

-- For the Transaction Path table:
--     - Make sure field naming convention matches the other tables
--         - i.e. instead of Account_From it should be Account From
-- For the Account Information table:
--     - Make sure there are no null values in the Account Holder ID
--     - Ensure there is one row per Account Holder ID
--         - Joint accounts will have 2 Account Holders, we want a row for each of them
-- For the Account Holders table:
--     - Make sure the phone numbers start with 07
-- Bring the tables together
-- Filter out cancelled transactions 
-- Filter to transactions greater than Â£1,000 in value 
-- Filter out Platinum accounts
